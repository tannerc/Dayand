# Dayand 0.5
A Mac status bar app for logging daily activities, your responses to them, and analyzing trends. Inspired by a tweet from Karri Saarinen.

Note this is a pre-release open source variant of Dayand. There are known issues within the architecture of the app, including occassional crashes caused by the moc. However I'm opening this up early for feedback, assistance, and in-case anyone wants to branch this into their own work.

## Capture your day

Dayand is designed to help you capture the activities you do throughout your day and your responses to them. Do meetings help you feel happy and energized or leave you feeling upset and drained? Are you most optimistic when you're focused on a project or planning ahead? Are there people or actions that make you feel better than others? Dayand will help you identify the trends.

With custom notification reminders, the app will randomly remind you to log whatever it is you're doing throughout the day so you can capture the most activities between working hours (or late night activities).

Chart your daily or day-over-day trends to see behaviors and export all logged activities and responses to CSV for further identify trends in behaviors and responses.

Future improvements are planned for the app as well, of course. Including the ability to edit activities previously logged, view trends by keywords or hashtags, and more visualizations.

## Designed to be open source

Dayand was built to be highly customizable for developers. Using SwiftUI and Core Data, developers can modify Dayand to better fit their unique needs or creativity.

Customize the types of responses from emojis to using up or down indicators, keywords, or more. Capture more data for each activity type. Adjust how activities are charted or exported, and much more.

If you build something cool with Dayand or improve the code, please let me know!

## How to use the app

Just build the app in Xcode and open to run as you would any other app. You'll see a Dayand menu icon in your status bar.

You can enable and disable notifications in the Settings menu, view logged activities in Activity, and quickly jump to this GitHub page directly from the in-app menu.

## Just download the app

Future state: Dayand is not currently release-ready.

Not interested in the source code? You can get Dayand directly in the Mac App Store once it reaches 1.0.
