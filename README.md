## Capture your day

Dayand is designed to help you capture the activities you do throughout your day and your responses to them. Do meetings help you feel happy and energized or leave you feeling upset and drained? Are you most optimistic when you're focused on a project or planning ahead? Are there people or actions that make you feel better than others? Dayand will help you identify the trends.

With custom notification reminders, the app will randomly remind you to log whatever it is you're doing throughout the day so you can capture the most activities between working hours (or late night activities).

Chart your daily or day-over-day trends to see behaviors and export all logged activities and responses to CSV for further identify trends in behaviors and responses.

Future improvements are planned for the app as well, of course. Including the ability to edit activities previously logged, view trends by keywords or hashtags, and more visualizations.

## Designed to be open source

Dayand was built to be highly customizable for developers. Using SwiftUI and Core Data, developers can modify Dayand to better fit their unique needs or creativity.

Customize the types of responses from emojis to using up or down indicators, keywords, or more. Capture more data for each activity type. Adjust how activities are charted or exported, and much more.

If you build something cool with Dayand or improve the code, please let me know!
